# Babylon.js Interactive 3D Scene

This project sets up an interactive 3D scene using Babylon.js, allowing you to interact with and manipulate 3D objects. It uses npm and Vite for development.

## Personal notes
I had a ton of fun working on this and learnt so many new stuff, but unfortunately I couldn't complete it. The shader outline part is still not working. I did write the shader code but could not debug and solve it within the time frame. Thank you for your time and this opportunity. This is what it is upto now :

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

 ```
 git clone <repository_url>
 ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  
```bash
cd babylon
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:
  
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server using Vite, bundling your Babylon.js code and serving it locally.

## Interacting with the Scene

- Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
- You will see an interactive 3D scene rendered using Babylon.js.
- Move your mouse over the 3D objects, and their names will be displayed in the browser console.
- You can also manipulate the scene, such as rotating the camera and exploring the 3D environment.
