# Babylon.js Interactive 3D Scene

This project sets up an interactive 3D scene using Babylon.js, allowing you to interact with and manipulate 3D objects. It uses npm and Vite for development.

## Personal notes
I had a ton of fun working on this and learnt so many new stuff, but unfortunately I couldn't complete it. The shader outline part is still not working. Thank you for your time and this opportunity. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

 ```
 git clone <repository_url>
 ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  
```bash
cd babylon
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:
  
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server using Vite, bundling your Babylon.js code and serving it locally.

## Interacting with the Scene

- Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
- You will see an interactive 3D scene rendered using Babylon.js.
- Move your mouse over the 3D objects, and their names will be displayed in the browser console.
- You can also manipulate the scene, such as rotating the camera and exploring the 3D environment.
